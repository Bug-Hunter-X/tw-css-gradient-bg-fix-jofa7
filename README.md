# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients: incorrect color specification leading to unexpected rendering results.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

**Problem:** The initial code uses colors that might not be defined within the Tailwind CSS palette, causing the gradient to fail to render as expected. 

**Solution:**  The solution ensures that the colors used are valid Tailwind CSS colors or utilize color names with defined values within the project's Tailwind configuration.

This example highlights the importance of verifying color names when utilizing Tailwind's utility classes.
