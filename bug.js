```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h1>This is a gradient background</h1>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS to create a gradient background. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are not specified correctly, the gradient might not render as expected, or it might not show at all.  For example, if you use colors that are not part of the Tailwind CSS color palette, the gradient won't apply correctly.
