```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h1>This is a gradient background</h1>
</div>
```
This corrected code uses valid Tailwind CSS color names (`blue-500` and `purple-500`), ensuring the gradient renders correctly.  Remember to check your Tailwind CSS configuration for any custom color definitions you might have added.
